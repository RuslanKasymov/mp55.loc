SEO Pro is a MODX Extra developed by Sterc. This Extra offers you guidance in the process of optimising your website for search engines. It enables you to enter focus keywords per page. Based on that input, SEO Pro provides you feedback on the SEO quality of your pagetitle, longtitle, description and alias by checking if the keywords are present.

Workflow:
1. Pick a page on your MODX website which you would like to optimise for search engines and click it.
2. Look for the field called 'Focus keywords'. Enter the keywords you would like to optimise your page for.
3. Take a look at the input fields with a 'Keywords' label. Make s  ure keywords are present here and you don't exceed the given length.
4. Save it.
